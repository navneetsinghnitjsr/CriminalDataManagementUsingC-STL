Now i am going to exicuting the code

1. apart of this 1st option
i'll describe rest portion this mini project.

so in the coading section we storing the Data of crime record using MAP containner
 
MAPs are used to replicate associative arrays

Maps contains sorted key value  pair, 
in which each keyis unique and cannot be changed
and it can be inserted or deleted but cannot be altered

-------------open code

now here 
we take 3 dataype 1st 
crime_code for storing the crime section number
crime_name[30];
that will store the informationn of crime name;

search_c it will store the crime code at the time of modify crime record section  

alreay create map containner.
here we take 2 keys value 
1st is integer type that will store the crime section number

and another is store crime name;

so when the user is insert the value for crime section number 

it will store into crime_code;

and when user store crime name it will store into crime_name


soo now using insert funtion 

we store the value into object of map container that is Crime_L  
with the using of pair class we take that value as a argument into pair class



 
in modify section
user inserted crime code value that ill be store into search_l 
after that
using find function we allow if condition to search crime code
if crime code found
first we erase last record using erase funtion
and then insert new record using pair class
and if the crime code is not found then you will see this massage

in delete section
user enter crime code
that will store into this crime_code variable
using count function we allow if condition to search crime code
if crime code found
then we erase last record using object.erase funtion

and if the crime code is not found then you will see this massage

View section
we allow for loop to view data using iterator object from map starting key value to end key value using begin funtion and end  funtion
and it will show the value using it obejct.first --->it will show 1st key value
and object.second---> it will show 2nd key value

and now i am going to output screen

------------------------------
:so the second option is Criminal Record.

:if we want to enter a record of any criminal information
then we choose this option 



Criminal record information can be two types.

it can be single person who done the crime

or more then one person 
who made crime named Gang record 

:if we Choose single criminal file option we get new menu
this is already visible 
add criminal details
modify criminal details
delete criminal details
view criminal details
and the last is exit

so we selecting the 1st option for adding a information of single criminal details

so fir details is 101
criminal name is raju
crime date for example 08/10/2010
and allocated officer :ramakant
crime status is open
which kind of crime is done by criminal 
lets example is robbary
is there any winess  
:: yeah its 2 witnes
enter witness name lets say:: rahul ravi
and now the information of criminal is succeessfully recored.
this process is done by using file handling 

:so now we are go to the coading section for better understaning how these process will done 
here
